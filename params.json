One hit is formed from the blog view, the other one from the administration panel hit if the setting is set to 'no'.\r\n\r\n##Why the sudden drop of visitors number when I upgraded to version 2.0?\r\n\r\nThe version 2.0 uses a completely new method to detect only real human visitors.\r\n\r\n#Screenshots\r\n\r\n1.
