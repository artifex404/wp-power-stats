== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it to work.

1. Upload `wp-power-stats.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip `wp-power-stats.zip` in the folder
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin does not work, what should I do? =

Disable and then re-enable the plugin in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
If that does not help, try disabling other installed plugins, to exclude the possibility of a plugin conflict.

= Where are the settings for the plugin located? =

They are located under 'Statistics' section in the 'Settings' section.

= When I test the plugin, the pageview number increments by 2, is it a bug? =

If you test the plugin by loading the blog, make sure that you have the setting 'Administration Exclusion' under the 'Exclusions' tab set to 'yes'. One hit is formed from the blog view, the other one from the administration panel hit if the setting is set to 'no'.

= Why the sudden drop of visitors number when I upgraded to version 2.0?

The version 2.0 uses a completely new method to detect only real human visitors.
